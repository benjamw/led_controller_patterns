# PixelBlaze Patterns

**NOTE**: the file needed to work on a PixelBlaze for each pattern is the `*.epe` file. The `*.js` files are
only supplied to offer an easy method of reviewing the code in the pattern and will _not_ work on a 
pixelblaze (although you could copy/paste the code into a new pattern on your own PixelBlaze and that would 
also work just fine).

Other patterns and originals of edited patterns can be found at [PixelBlaze Patterns](https://electromage.com/patterns).
